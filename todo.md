# Project Todo

- [ ] **Library Stats**: Display total count of Movies and TV Series available in the library.
- [ ] **Rewatch Leaderboard**: A top list for "Most Rewatched Episodes" (displaying top 5 or 10, not just the single "Most Watched").
- [ ] **"The Interruption King" (Most Paused)**: Track the item with the highest pause count.
    - *Note: Need to investigate if Tautulli API exposes pause event counts per session.*
- [ ] **Global Popularity Leaderboard**: Top list of Movies and Series ranked by how many unique users have watched them.
